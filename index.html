        <h2 id="me">My Writing Background</h2>
              <p> I have had an affinity for storytelling ever since I had the ability to write and speak. I admire the process of gathering information and transforming it into a well-designed report on a topic.
              <br><br> I want to partake in disseminating factual and engaging news to inform and inspire the public. </p> <br>

              <p>As a recent graduate from Concordia University in the Journalism program, I have had the opportunity to develop my reporting, researching and writing skills.</p>

            <p>I have taken research methods courses that taught me how to use databases such as JSTOR, ProQuest and EBSCO, prompting me to further my research when writing an article.</p>


           <p>Although my degree focuses on the written aspect of journalism, I have taken courses that enabled me to learn the basics of audiovisual journalism. I learned the functions of an HTML and HDMI camera as well as how to navigate publishing software applications such as InDesign, Photoshop, and Final Cut Pro. </p>

           <p>Shortly after graduating University, I completed one internship at CJAD and another at Rank Media. Both internships taught me proper time management and good research skills.   </p> <br>

           <p>I now volunteer my time writing for the Tyndale St-Georges seasonal newsletter.</p>
